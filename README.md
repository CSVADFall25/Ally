## Student Sample

I am a second-year Computer Science masters student. I also completed my undergrad at UCSB in CS. I’m interested in learning how code can be used in creative ways beyond traditional applications. I want to get a better understanding of how interface design can change the way people create art and media. In my free time, I enjoy reading, baking, and tennis.
